                    Hello Tata
<br><br>
                
Helloooo….????? HAHA
<br><br>
 Ok.
<br><br>
Here goes. 
<br><br>
Dear Tata,  I’m actually writing this letter for the third time (Surat draft pertama ilang Karena laptopku gabisa nyala dan aku human save di Notes app laptop huhuhu, yang kedua rencananya video message gitu tape bingung nanti host di websitenya Gimana wkwkwk).   But hey ho it is your special day! So, of course I have to write you a third - and finally hopeful draft. Because, like our relationship, the first draft in back in middle-school somehow didn’t work out, the second one either - but luckily was given another third chance to take a shot at it. And yes I’m glad we did take it hohoho.
<br><br>
Thank you Tata for being that special someone who is always there for me. Through thick and thin, through ups and downs, and through damaged laptops and overheated phones. But really though, I appreciate you listening to all I have to say, my worries, dreams and insecurities. And I double appreciate you for your honest criticism and feedback when I need it most, be it for business ideas HAHA bluntly telling me aspects I might overlook or underestimate, but what I cherish most is your reassurance - telling me to take a break when I deserve it and not be too hard on myself.  Thank you for that.
 Likewise, I am happy that you share your life with me too. Your ups and downs studying for OSCE, the drama of not being able to go for exchange, the rise and fall of WINX Club (?), but also your journey to where u at now. I am proud to see you grow and successfully accomplish what you ought to accomplish so far. Im happy to hear that you found new friendships along the way through KOAS and also get to meet awesome resident doctors and nurses along the way. I hope that you will get the best out of KOAS this year and hope everything will be okay despite the current circumstances.  You got this babe!   Also, I guess besides the third time writing this, it will also be the third time for me not being able to physically celebrate with you. I guess that sucks but oh well, we make do with whatever we have right. 
<br><br>
And to that, I would like to present this ‘Scrapbook of Sorts’! A compilation of narcissistic photos of us to document our journey so far - so that it won’t get lost in my laptop/phone just in case (highly likely) but also so that we can celebrate the past 3 years together too. 
<br><br>
I miss you ta, I miss eating good food with you (Warung SS ugh yum) and going on culinary road trips with you. And I hope to redeem our failed salted egg chicken cooking last time.
<br><br>
But I hope to see you soon, and hopefully we can fill in more photos in this scrapbook of sorts! Cheers to that!
 Alright thennn…that’s all from me for now. 
<br><br>
I do hope that you have a blessed year ahead ta, and I wish you lots of love from here. Oh, and big hugs from me too.  HAPPY 23rd BIRTHDAY!
<br><br>
Love, Raymond
